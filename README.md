# Concrete Strength Prediction (Toy Project)

This is a toy project that predicts the strength of a concrete material using machine learning.

The project performs predictions in two stages:
1. Predicts the material strength **without applying any transformation**.
2. Predicts the material strength **after applying both Box-Cox and Yeo-Johnson transformations** to the input features.

The goal is to understand the impact of feature transformations on model performance.
